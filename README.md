# starter
This repo consists of branches based on a basic webpack boilerplate. Each branch is meant as a simple starting place for new projects that need the features of the branch.

## basic react starter

This basic react branch has both prod and dev configs including a dev server. It also includes react with stage-0 babel presets.

To get started clone the repo and run `yarn install`. Then you can start the dev server with `yarn serve` or build for prod with `yarn build`.
